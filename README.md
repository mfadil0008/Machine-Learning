Attribute Information:

Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description

* x1 : Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
* x2 : Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
* x3 : Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
* x4 : Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
* x5 : Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
* x6 : Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
* x7 : Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
* x8 : Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
* y : Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
